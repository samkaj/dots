# samkaj's dots!

I'll save my dots here, I am using i3-gaps, picom and polybar on my manjaro machine.

## My installs

If you want to use any of the configs in `.config` it will most likely work if you have everything stated below installed.

- [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) - compositor, I use it mainly for blurred background effects and rounded corners.
- [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) - my bar. Spotify support is accomplished with [Polybar Spotify Module](https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-spotify-module)
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) - my wm with [autotiling](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/autotiling) installed.
- [NVim](https://neovim.io/) with [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/vim) theme.
- VS Code with my own theme, malte. I will publish it to the marketpalce later.

## Fonts used

- Inter nerd font.
- Hack nerd font.
