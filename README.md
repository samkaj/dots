# samkaj's dots!

I'll save my dots here, I am using i3, picom and polybar on my arch machine.

## My installs

If you want to use any of the configs in [`config`](config) it will most likely work if you have everything stated below installed.

- [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) - compositor, I use it mainly for blurred background effects and rounded corners.
- [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) - my bar. Spotify support is accomplished with [Polybar Spotify Module](https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-spotify-module)
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) - my wm with [autotiling](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/autotiling) installed. It is pretty uninteresting, but feel free to use regardless.

## Fonts used

- Inter nerd font.
- Hack nerd font.
- FiraCode nerd font.

## Wallpapers

I do not want to upload images which are not mine, but I use [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for finding them.
